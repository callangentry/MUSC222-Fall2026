        <title>Course Description</title>

        <p>
         An introduction to the hardware, software, and techniques involved with composing, editing and producing digital music. The primary goal is to gain a working facility and knowledge of fundamental technologies found within a modern music production environment such as digital audio workstation (DAW) software, file management, mixing techniques, sound editing, sequencing, sampling, sound design, and synthesis. Foremost is the creative application of these skills that result in original pieces of music, sound design environments, and emulated modular synthesizer design.

              Don’t just read it; fight it!
              Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs.
              Is the hypothesis necessary?
              Is the converse true?
              What happens in the classical special case?
              What about the degenerate cases?
              Where does the proof use the hypothesis?
